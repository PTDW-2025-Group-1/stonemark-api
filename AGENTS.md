# AI Agent Guidelines

## Code Quality & Style
- **Java 21**: Utilize modern Java 21 syntax and features where appropriate.
- **Readability**: Prioritize "boring", readable code over clever one-liners. Do not condense logic unnecessarily.
- **Maintainability**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain for future developers.
- **Reusability**: Prefer parameterizing logic and reusing existing code over duplication.

## Comments & Documentation
- **Value**: Comments must add real value. Avoid redundant comments that simply state what the code is doing.
- **Context**: Focus on explaining the *why* behind complex logic or decisions, rather than the *how*.

## Architecture & Performance
- **Goals**: All changes should aim for long-term reliability, scalability, and performance.
- **Best Practices**: Adhere to established design patterns and architectural principles suitable for the project.

## Workflow
- **Clarification**: If a request implies a significant implementation or is ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- **Scope**: Stick to the requested changes unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
